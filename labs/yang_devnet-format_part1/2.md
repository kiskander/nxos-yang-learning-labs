### Installing the Packages

In order to install the packages that were just copied over, we need to use the **bash shell** Linux environment that exists on each switch.

Now log into the **both** switches using separate terminal sessions. Then execute the following commands to enable and switch to the bash shell on each of the switches:

``` shell
nx-osv9000-1(config)#feature bash-shell
nx-osv9000-1(config)#
nx-osv9000-1(config)#run bash sudo su
bash-4.2#

```

On **each** device, navigate to the `bootflash` directory, where we copied the RPMs over and install them using the `yum` package manager.

Install the infrastructure components (remember, this one is platform independent):

> Don't forget, this needs to be done for **nx-osv9000-1** and **nx-osv9000-2**.
[ Kareem - running the yum command gives No package mtx-infra-1.0.0-r1705191346.x86_64.rpm available. obviously it's missing from previous steps perhaps?]

> For any given technology, more than one model can be installed on the device (as we will see, when we learn about OpenConfig YANG models in Part 3). Unique namespaces are used to distinguish the different installed models.  For example, you can install the OpenConfig BGP model and have the NXOS model that supports BGP installed at the same time.


Next install the NETCONF agent on both **nx-osv9000-1** and **nx-osv9000-2**:

This completes the installation of the programmable infrastructure interface and NETCONF agent packages.  Next, we'll enable NETCONF on the switch so we can start building data structures that use one of the models we installed on the switch.
